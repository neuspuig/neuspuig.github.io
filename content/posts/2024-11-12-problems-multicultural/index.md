Traditional working teams have experienced a transformation, and they have posed challenges and problems in multicultural companies. Avoiding making mistakes can be overwhelming, because there are various aspects at stake.

In today’s article we summarize which are the fundamental aspects that must be taken into account when dealing with a pluricultural environment, and we show you some successful examples of it.

## The advantages of working in a multicultural company

The benefits of a multicultural company can be visible on the team, as well as their results.

* Having a team with a very heterogeneous background means that there are different ways of thinking, creating a favourable setting in which creativity can flow and innovative ideas generate.
* Having innovative ideas improves productivity, because plural perspectives are available in order to overcome a challenge; an analysis from different perspectives is key to get to the solution.
* A multicultural company will have easier access to new markets, having resolved various cultural barriers at the beginning. With a multicultural team, it is possible to overcome new markets with higher confidence.
* Developing skills and abilities to work on the global scale and having obstacle-free interactions with other cultures.

## What are the problems in multicultural companies

In order to manage multicultural teams successfully, one must know the main challenges that a multicultural company poses. As the cultural diversity researcher José Javier Romero stated in the digital newspaper [_El Confidencial_](https://www.elconfidencial.com/empresas/2019-10-14/multinacionales-incomunicacion-empresas_2268479/), language is just a form of transportation and, with multiculturality, these flaws in understanding can become a problem.

### Different work dynamics

So many men, so many minds, but the truth is that there are some patterns of behaviour in the workplace. It is important to keep them in mind and identify them properly to manage your team successfully.

The [Lewis model](https://www.crossculture.com/the-lewis-model-dimensions-of-behaviour/?cn-reloaded=1) is a theory of cultural types developed by the British linguist and theorist Richard D. Lewis in his book When Cultures Collide, which is about work cultures around the world. His model broadly describes three patterns of behaviour regarding work and offers examples of countries that fit the three categories. That is to say, the linear-active group (oriented towards tasks), the multi-active group (towards people) and the reactive group (focused on respect). For example, Germany and Sweden would be two countries that fit in the first group; the Mediterranean cultures would be part of the multi-active, and Asian countries such as China and Japan would fit the reactive group.

### Hierarchy

There are cultures in which respecting hierarchies and following the rules is top priority. Then, in a work environment like this, expressing opinions that differ to the ones from your senior colleague could be sort of frowned upon. It can affect the members of a multicultural team if they are accustomed to this dynamic and, therefore, feel inhibited when doing some tasks.

Having limits that are too tight when assigning each team member responsibilities negatively affects the decision-making process and the workflow, because people are afraid to do tasks that involve a senior colleague.

### Communication

There are occasions in which the problems of multicultural companies appear due to misunderstandings or a failure when communicating with the team. Not only is it the seed that sprouts a conflict, it also affects negatively on the desired results. A clear and direct communication of the responsibilities and tasks expected contributes to the transparent and the successful completion of the work.

Likewise, it is important that the team feels encouraged to express their concerns and doubts, and to suggest improvements. This is the way to a collaborative work environment, in which getting feedback will improve the relations between colleagues and departments.

Understanding these challenges in order to avoid problems in multicultural companies is nurtured with certain values and attitudes, like acknowledging and accepting the differences, mutual respect and a vision to adapt and identify what your team needs.

## Examples of managing multicultural teams

Hereunder, we have summarized some examples that successfully overcome the previously mentioned challenges.

* Business coach César Piqueras suggests workshops in order to educate the team members. This way, it is possible to acknowledge the cultural differences in the workplace.
* Hierarchies turned out to be an obstacle when concluding a negotiation smoothly with [a company that expanded towards China](https://www.ptl-group.com/blog/5-communication-challenges-international-companies-face-in-china-and-how-to-solve-them/). The analysts in the meeting couldn't get to a final decision because they felt like they needed to consult with their manager first, who wasn’t attending the meeting. Including a new equivalent authority figure in future meetings was the solution to streamline the negotiations: it shows understanding of how your team works and what are their needs.
* HubSpot cofounder and technology manager [Dharmesh Shah](https://www.hubspot.com/blog/bid/8174/hubspotters-can-ask-co-founder-dharmesh-shah-anything) published an article called “Ask Dharmesh Anything” with the intention of improving communications between management and the workers. Some of the questions were more casual (like the name of his newborn son) and others were related to the company (the reason behind the name HubSpot). Giving the possibility to the whole team to feel encouraged to ask questions through a specific site is a motivation to ask them in the company in the future and promotes a work culture in which debate is valued. This way efficiency is boosted and cultural barriers disappear.

## Comprehension will avoid problems in multicultural companies

Coming up with solutions to navigate the various problems in multicultural companies and overcoming the challenges that they pose requires a broad vision and the skill to value difference. The observation of the behaviours and the idiosyncrasy of your team allows analysing which are their needs and thinking up how to solve them in order to function smoothly.

It is only through the ability to adapt to new ways and having the willingness to apply new solutions that we can reach the solution to the challenges that are present along the way.
